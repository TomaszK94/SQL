CASE EXPRESSION

A CASE expression in SQL is a way to apply conditional logic within your SQL queries.

CASE - begins the expression
WHEN - specifies the condition(s) to look at
THEN - what to do when the condition is TRUE
ELSE (optional) - provides output if none of the WHEN condition are met
END - concludes the CASE expression
