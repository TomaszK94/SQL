### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To identify the skills needed for top-paying jobs, job postings were combined with skills data, offering insights into what employers prioritize for high-compensation positions.

``` SQL
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (

SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_dim.skill_id) AS skill_count,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY salary_year_avg) AS median_salary
FROM 
    top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
GROUP BY 
    skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    skill_count DESC,
    median_salary DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

``` Python
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6), facecolor="black")

palette= sns.color_palette("YlOrRd", n_colors=6)

sns.set_theme(style="ticks")
sns.barplot(data=job_skills, x="skill_count", y="skills", hue="skill_count", palette=palette, legend=False)
sns.despine()

ax = plt.gca()  
ax.set_facecolor("black")  

plt.grid(axis="x", color="gray", linestyle="--", linewidth=0.5, alpha=0.7, zorder=0)
plt.title("Skill Count for Top 10 Paying Data Analyst Jobs", color='white', fontsize=15, fontweight='bold', pad=20)  
plt.ylabel("")  
plt.xlabel("")  

ax.tick_params(axis='x', colors='white', labelsize=12)  
ax.tick_params(axis='y', colors='white', labelsize=12)  
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(pad=8)

plt.show()
```
